**Escape The Dungeon** is an interactive Python game I developed as the final project for the [Code in Place 2025](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/2025/showcase/?project=Hkx72K4JyPeu3CnpoaUYXZQw8Jm2) course by Stanford University. It's a narrative-driven text adventure where each choice influences your fate.
